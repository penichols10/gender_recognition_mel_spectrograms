# Introduction
This repo is primarily for developing a deep learning model to predict gender from voice audio. The notebook in which it is developed contains a detailed but fairly non-technical discussion of mel spectrograms

# Notable Files

[cv_analysis.ipynb](cv_analysis.ipynb) is the notebook in which the model is developed


[mp3_to_wav.bat](mp3_to_wav.bat) Is a batch file to mass convert .mp3 files to .wav files using [ffmpeg on Windows](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/). This was written for how I have my project set up locally, but could easily be useful for anyone who needs to perform similar tasks.
